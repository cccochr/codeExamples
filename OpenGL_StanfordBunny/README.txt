Title: "The Swift Bunny in the Night"

Using OpenGL we were successful in parsing a plyfile containing the coordinates and faces of the Stanford Bunny. There is classic 3-Point Hollywood lighting, the geometry is put into vertex arrays, using Phong Shading in the normalized Blinn-Phong shader. It it anti-aliasing with multisampling. Additionally we were able to implement Motion Blur and Depth of Field.
 
This package contains a ply file, source code, and a Makefile for compiling and running our group's code.

To Compile: make

To Run: ./bunny
